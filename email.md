**Subject: 📊 Your Data Detective Skills Are Needed! 🕵️‍♂️**

Dear esteemed members of J677 Data Analytics Agency,

We hope you’re all having a fantastic day! We’re reaching out from the Small News Website (the little site that could) with some web analytics data that we’re sharing because, honestly, we have no idea how to analyze it ourselves!

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to dig into the numbers and uncover how our website is performing. Is it thriving like a sunflower or struggling like a lost sock in the laundry? We’d love for you to write a short report based on your analysis to help us make sense of it all.

Our web analytics data is [here](web_analytics.csv). And don’t hold back—feel free to sprinkle in some memes for extra flair!

Happy analyzing, and may the data be ever in your favor!

Best,  
The Small News Website Team

P.S. If you find any clues that we’re secretly run by cats, we definitely want to know! 🐱
